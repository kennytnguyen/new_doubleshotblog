walking through HP Pavillion, going to a seperate booth that overlooks the rest of the seats, \n            having catered pizza, live televisions, and drinks was something out of the ordinary. But one thing I remembered was my dad telling me\n          </p>\n          <Quote\n            textClassName={classes.quoteText}\n            text=\"“Don't take anything, they might charge us for it.”\"\n          /> \n          <p>\n            and that always stuck with me. \n            Even as a pre-teenager I always thought why my dad always had this reoccuring thought of there being a consequence to things being too good to be true.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          \n          <h3 class=\"section-heading\">Financial Awareness</h3>\n\n          <p>\n            Growing up I never thought about the cost of toys, video games, food, rent, gas, or <i>anything</i> for that matter. \n            A video game at the was about $60 after tax. \n            If you worked minimum wage back then, you would be getting paid about $8.25 per hour.\n            So to buy that game after your paycheck gets taxed, you would have to work a full 8 hours to afford it. That's an entire work day... just for one video game.\n          </p>\n          \n          <p>\n            <b>Well ain't that some shit.</b>\n          </p>\n\n          <p>That's kind of insane isn't it? All this time I've been walking around like money falls out the sky and the reason why I stopped thinking that was is because of what my dad told me that day. He just made me realize how hard it is to earn money and that his entire life he's been working just so me, his kid, can have a measley video game and enjoy my life unlike his childhood upbringing.</p>\n          <br></br>\n\n          <h3 class=\"section-heading\">The times we did spend together </h3>\n\n          <p>was afterhours when my mom, brother, and sister were all asleep and my dad would be having his usual pre-sleep routine, a couple of beers and 96.5 KOIT soft rock music while sitting down on the couch by the kitchen. Growing up, this segment of time past 10:30-11PM were my favorite because it was when I could lay my head on my dad's comfortable beer belly and just hear him tell me stories about when he was growing up.</p>\n\n          <p>\n            He would talk about how he grew up swimming in the ocean, catching fish, or just plain old being an adventurous kid in a third world country. \n            Pretty straight forward, pretty plain and simple, pretty interesting... but that's when I realized there was a huge gap in the timestamps of each of these stories. \n            My father would always talk about his time as a child, eating rice for dinner and explaining that when he yells \"eat rice\" in Vietnamese, it means dinner because they were so poor all they had to eat for dinner was rice. \n            Or he would talk about the time when he was in Chicago on loans, in debt, and having nothing to eat because he couldn't afford to eat. \n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b> This was all the process of him making me aware, making me realize, and above all, making me appreciate. </b>\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n          \n          <h3 class=\"section-heading\">The Puzzling Gap</h3>\n\n          <p>\n            Well I mentioned that gap, between the approximate ages of 12 and 18. I would get in depth with what I know, but the problem is that <b><i>I don't know anything</i></b> about that era of his life.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            I'm sure that is why he is so overprotective of me, because of his foresight and paranoia of disasterous events that shroud his sanity. I don't know what it is that makes him mention to me that\n          </p>\n\n          <Quote\n            textClassName={classes.quoteText}\n            text=\"“You should always look for emergency exits. \n            Always keep your distance from cars in front of you because if they break, it's instant death. \n            Always prepare for the worst because you never know when something bad might happen.”\"\n          /> \n\n          <p>\n            Something bad probably happened to him that he doesn't want to get into. All he told me was that his father passed away when he was young, due to unknown circumstances. \n            Maybe I don't want to know because I'll feel guilty that I couldn't do anything to prevent it. He's been through so much and the worst part about it all is that, \n            I don't know a single thing that he's been through because he's always avoided telling me all the bad. Probably the sole reason why he wants to prevent any bad from happening, because he had encountered so much of it. \n          </p>\n\n          <p>All he has given me is happiness and I don't even know it. \n            I've taken him for granted all this time and I'm not ashamed to hear people say that I'm just like my dad. He's a fantastic father and a fantastic person that puts his family first, himself last, and cares about others. \n            He just expects that others care about him too. That's it.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            It's kind of amazing because this is just one story where someone's parents do everything they can for their kids when it's the case with tons of people, because after all, we are all children to someone.\n          </p>\n         \n        </GridItem>\n      </GridContainer>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n","import React from \"react\";\n// nodejs

Springfest 2015 was my first concert <b><i>ever</i></b> during my first semester at USC as a Spring Admit. \n            A little background on the type of person I was between my first day in college and Springfest, \n            I was an introvert that didn't go out to parties, concerts, or social gatherings to begin with. \n            So Springfest being my first event, I was already discouraged at the idea of going even if all my friends were going.\n          </p>\n          <p> \n            Thankfully, I went and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I want people to experience the same thing I did when I went to 2015's Springfest. \n            That was my first concert ever and I had a blast. \n            2015's Springfest got me hooked onto live music and convinced me to go to Mountain View's BFD, which led to Hard Summer, which also led to Outside Lands. \n            Since then I've gone to a handful of festivals and small shows.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n\n          <h3 className={classes.title}>\n            Free Shit, Fun Shit, Music\n          </h3>\n          <p>\n            <i>Just as a disclaimer the rest of my writing is pretty critical because it's about a subject that I'm relatively passionate about. I want everyone to experience fantastic live music so when that experience is ruined for others I get all types of riled up.</i>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The primary objective of USC Concerts Committee is to bring the beauty of live performances and convince students that have never previously been to a concert before, \n            that seeing artists live is not the same as pressing play on your iPod or computer.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n              To give a soft recap of my 2015 Springfest, Walla played first and they were pretty cool, \n              they were perfect for the Spring vibe and the early timeslot that they were given. \n              This was when we ran around to all the fun booths and grabbed free stuff. \n              By the time the sun was starting to set, Borns, Portugal the Man, and GTA got on stage each and \n              every single one of them destroyed their respective timeslots and gave students something to be more than satisfied with. \n              All of those artists were beyond fantastic for the 3 hours they played and it was obvious that whoever reached out to them, \n              knew that they would perform great live and give the students a show to remember.\n          </p>\n          <p> \n            I wish every show since Springfest 2015 was just as good if not better, but this has not been the case because the last good concert was almost 2 years ago. \n            I'm not saying that any of these artists that came in recent memory are bad, \n            I'm just saying if a committee whose purpose is to bring great live performances and introduce the beauty of live music to people who have never experienced it before, \n            USC Concerts Committee isn't doing a fantastic job at it.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n              I'm seeing all these kids and people come out to USC's low energy concerts and see that they feel the urge to not come back and think they're all a waste of time. \n              But they're not, you just have the wrong people introducing it to you. \n              Just like anything new you try or retry, you'll always have to base it off the first experience you've had with it.\n          </p>\n          <br></br>\n\n          <h3 className={classes.title}>\n            Free Shit, Fun Shit, Music\n          </h3>\n\n          <Quote\n

It doesn’t really matter if they’re people you like, people you hate, people you love, \n            people you’re apathetic towards. I hold onto this idea with a tight grip because I truly think that the best way to learn about \n            yourself is to meet people because each person I ever met presented me with opportunities to self-reflect. \n            This doesn’t mean that they’re necessarily going to ask you questions about yourself necessarily, \n            it’s just that, when you leave the interaction or receive a first impression you come out understanding a little bit more about \n            yourself and what you care about relative to the individual you met.\n            <br /><br />\n            More thoughts, more people, more reflection points all add onto and help expand your scale in terms of how you view the world, \n            people, and those around you. This is particularly important because every experience, interaction, or impression you receive \n            will always fit somewhere along this indefinite scale of yours. Ranging from 0 to 100 or 1000 or 10000000, 0 being \n            <i>“I absolutely hated everything about that”</i> and the other end being a euphoric feeling of happiness and fulfillment, \n            each experience will fit somewhere in between. If an experience is worse than your current idea of “0” \n            then you know to say fuck that shit and move on with your life. If a particular interaction makes you feel happy in \n            comparison to your current idea of “happiness or 100000” then you know to hold onto that person or experience quite dearly.\n            <br /><br />\n            This is was one of my biggest takeaways of 2019 because I expanded my scale to the point where it’s very difficult for \n            me to find people or experience things that tip the very ends of my scale, but also to that point it makes me very grateful \n            that I’m consistently put in situations where I don’t feel extremely negative towards anything. One thing I will say though, \n            is I’m anticipating more experiences and people that turn 1000 to 1001, instead of fitting somewhere in between. \n            <br /><br />\n            Think of a tape measure, the more you experience the longer you can measure.\n          </p>\n\n          <GridContainer>\n            <GridItem>\n            <h6>You want a long boi</h6>\n              <img\n                src={scale}\n                alt=\"You want a long boi\"\n                className={classes.imgRounded + \" \" + classes.imgFluid}\n              />\n            </GridItem>\n          </GridContainer>\n          <br />\n\n          <h3 className={classes.title}>\n            Meeting People as a Young Adult\n          </h3>\n          <p>\n            I get asked about how I’m able to meet people post-grad because it’s apparently on the more difficult-side but my answer is always the same. \n            Just be single or go out more. It is extremely beneficial and easy to meet people as a single individual, \n            not because there are expectations or implications but rather because there is little need to feel obligated or consider \n            someone else within the indirect impact of your actions. There is no one to get upset at you for:\n            <br /><br />\n            <ul>\n              <li>Staying out late</li>\n              <li>Exploring new activities</li>\n              <li>Bonding with people, both new and old</li>\n              <li>Drinking and having too fun without their presence</li>\n              <li>Meeting new interesting people</li>\n            </ul>\n            <br /><br />\n            Touching upon the latter part of my answer, I found that the best way to meet people is through alcohol consumption \n            (if you couldn’t already tell) because it’s a social lubricant and helps put you in positions where you can really get to \n            know people in a short amount of time.\n            <br /><br />\n            Pre-games help me get a feel for how I should act to best get along with the group(s) I’m with. \n            It’s usually an opportunity for me to observe, react, and adapt in different environments and conversations. \n            One thing I noticed about myself is that when I’m in a room full of strangers I tend to say less and observe more (<i>More on this later</i>), \n            and in a room with people I know, I tend to express my strong personality.\n            <br /><br />           \n            The destination (club, concert, etc.) is how I get a better understanding for people’s prioritizations when they go out. \n            I know that a lot of people have different agendas for when they go out. I personally just like spending time with my friends, \n            listening to music we like, and dancing in a group setting. If people’s agendas are to find people to hook-up with or some type of \n            physical reaffirmation from strangers, that’s usually a sign for me to be more cautious and refrain from bringing people whom I care \n            about around them. This matters to me because I like bringing people together (especially different groups of friends), \n            so having to watch out for individuals who have specific intentions is inherently exhausting.\n            <br /><br />\n            The best part is what comes after the club, when you and all your friends (old or new) all go back to someone’s place and \n            talk for hours about each other’s lives, experiences, and perspectives. \n            I love this because it’s what really allows me to get to know new people. I wish I lived in the city for this reason but \n            I’m always stuck having to leave by 4 or 5AM to drive back to South Bay. \n            I love showering and sleeping in my own bed so I guess this is a trade-off I have to make.\n            <br /><br />\n            This series of events is what I think is important towards building friendships at a “younger” age when we have more opportunities \n            to explore and meet new people because we have the energy and time to do so. \n            Going out is something I’ll never take for granted since I’ve met so many great people and maintained friendships just by \n            gathering large groups of people around bottles of alcohol.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n\n          <h3 className={classes.title}>\n            Mitigating Work Overlap\n          </h3>\n          <p>\n            <i>Work to live, not live to work.</i> Is something I tell a lot of people because I truly think that there should be almost \n            zero overlap between work and personal life. I won’t elaborate too much here but it’s just healthy that you have multiple different \n            “personalities” built into your… singular personality. The ability to context switch between diverse groups of people can only benefit \n            you in the long run. There’s a time and place for everything and frankly not every part of who I really am is suited for work and workplace \n            Kenny might not be ideal for social settings. I try not to have any overlap as a means of preserving different aspects of my personality. \n          </p>\n          <br />\n\n          <h3 className={classes.title}>\n            Being Different\n          </h3>\n          <p>\n            For me, I personally also don’t like talking about work, career, and school outside the workplace because I feel like \n            they don’t make me who I am as a person. There are so many other aspects of me or my life that drive passion, ambition, \n            and motivation to wake up everyday that I almost feel offended if people only cared to talk about those things with me. \n            Thus it’s rather difficult to convey to strangers or express upon first impressions that I don’t care about the \n            surface-level shit and I genuinely want to get to know them as people (which can be intimidating or off-putting). \n            <br /><br />\n            In the times I am presented with superficial and unimportant conversation topics, \n            I am quick to brush them off to move on with my life. It’s why I’m awful with small talk because most of the time, \n            I just don’t give a shit about questions prying me about minute aspects of my life that don’t make up who I am as a person. \n            This understanding that a lot of people tend to attach hobbies, activities, and interests with an \n            individual’s personality is also what strives me to want to be different. \n            <br /><br />\n              <b>It’s why I will never consider myself a raver </b> <i>(despite loving music and festivals).</i>\n              <br />\n              <b>It’s why I’m sometimes ashamed to say I work in tech</b> <i>(even though I'm at Facebook).</i>\n              <br />\n              <b>It’s why I never felt incentivized to join any clubs, organizations, and fraternities in college.</b>\n              <br />\n              <b>It’s why I always try to be skeptical and go against the grain.</b>\n              <br /><br />\n            It’s not that I necessarily want to be a hipster or want to be unique. \n            I just don’t want to be bucketed into groups of people who I struggle to find commonalities with and have no relation to. \n            <br /><br />\n            <i>Don’t trap me because I have already felt this way my entire life.</i>\n          </p>\n          <br />\n\n          <h3 className={classes.title}>\n            Being Alone\n          </h3>\n          <p>\n            For complete context, I live about a 5 minute drive from work and work is in Menlo Park, CA\n            (about ~35 miles from San Francisco or a 40 minute drive). This leaves me with a lot of free time after work \n            as I don’t spend time commuting, but as a result also leaves me stuck in the suburbs with limited social interaction \n            and activities throughout the week. Don’t get me wrong, it sounds a little awful to be mostly alone for 5-6 days out of the week, \n            but it’s actually the best. Might I also add that on top of being physically alone, \n            2019 was my first full-year as a legitimate adult with a new(er) mentality on life, relationships, and self.\n            <br /><br />\n            The best and one thing I really want to emphasize about my year was that I found a lot of enjoyment, peace, and solitude \n            in growing my independence and being alone. I didn’t do it on purpose since it was just a bi-product of constantly being \n            in an environment that was removed from distractions, entertainment, and people. I carried on my own conversations in my \n            head, found things to occupy my time with, and discovered new methods of entertainment. One of the many conclusions \n            throughout this semi-arduous thinking process is that I have all the reasons in the world to always put myself first \n            whenever it comes to my own priorities and values.\n            <br /><br />\n            This thought process contributes directly to what I personally think is one of the most important aspects of growing up \n            which is learning how to be independent or finding independence. \n            Independence is much more than cooking for yourself because it’s also mental and emotional alongside physical independence. \n            <br /><br />\n            <b><i>Mental independence</i></b> to me is being able to introspect and be self-aware to the point where I am able to drive conversations related to self values and worth without needing someone reaffirm me of my beliefs or think on my behalf; it’s being able to think for yourself and your own actions. \n            <br /><br />\n            <b><i>Emotional independence</i></b> is being happy with doing things alone whether it’s eating out by yourself or simply spending the entire day indoors interacting with nobody. This idea of happily alone is not being dependent on others to uphold or make you happy, it’s what personally I think makes me ready for a relationship without needing or wanting to be in one. \n            <br /><br />\n            The lack of emotional independence is something I witness people lack a strong grasp or understanding of. \n            Being the observant person I am, I witness a lot of people who aren’t ready to be alone so then they put \n            themselves in situations where they crave for another person to help take care of all their problems (career, mental, emotional, etc.). \n            They grow to become dependent on another person and can easily justify the state, trajectory, or “health” of their relationship \n            in any way they see fit. \n            <br /><br />\n            People begin to project their greatest insecurities and problems onto each other and then it gets to the point \n            where they are so dependent that they attempt to leech off one another even though there’s nothing positive to leech off of. \n            That’s the vicious cycle of a toxic relationship, it’s essentially just people who don’t know how to be alone attempting to fill \n            a void in their life with someone else, dragging that person down with them.\n            <br /><br />\n            <div className={classes.typo}>\n              <div className={classes.note}></div>\n              <Quote\n                text=\"I believe that 80% of relationships in the world are horseshit. \n                      A bunch of people who never took time to learn how to be alone, \n                      therefore never learned how to love themselves, so you employed someone else to do it.\"\n                author=\" Daniel Sloss, Comedian\"\n              />\n            </div>\n            I’ve learned to focus on myself and leave my problems up for just me to solve. \n            Granted, it’s healthy to know that you’re never alone but this is part of me having learned how to be selfish.\n            This comes from privilege however, I’m lucky to have a handful of friends that respect my space and will always be there for me.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n\n          <h3 className={classes.title}>\n            Selfishness\n          </h3>\n          <p>\n            Being selfish is something I noticed a lot of people try to do but I’d really want to baseline two definitions I have for being selfish. \n            In both scenarios you have a person and their problem in relation to a group of people. To me and possibly to others, an unhealthy form \n            of selfishness is when that person allows their problems to spill over into the group of friends or family, expecting others in their \n            life to interject and help solve this problem with absolutely zero contextual knowledge. It’s when someone’s actions will inhibit the \n            lives and stability of those around them no matter how minute the problem may be. \n            <br /><br />\n            The flipside is when a person is selfish in that they take full ownership of their time, resources, and problems and ensures that their \n            selfishness does not negatively affect others in their life. My problems are mine (don’t solve them for me), \n            I’m going to be selfish with my time and not share it with anyone else (I want to be more selective with my time), \n            I’m going to be selfish with my resources (I won’t share my tangible goods or intangible knowledge). \n            Being selfish allows me to give myself opportunities to focus on hobbies, activites, or myself. \n            I personally find this more aligned with what I think is healthy and because of this idea of selfishness, \n            it’s very easy for me to disregard activities, peer pressure, or obligations to put my priorities and myself first.\n            <br /><br />\n            The latter concept of selfishness however only works if you, your friends, and your family are all people you can rely on to \n            take ownership of their own lives and be selfish in their own regard. For me, it’s important to surround myself with people \n            who I can depend on to be selfish with their time because it means they give a shit about themselves, which is something \n            I’d want in my friends since I actually care that they have opportunities to put themselves first.\n            <br /><br />\n            Good friends will always be around and strive to improve themselves without you needing to push them, and vice-versa. \n            Good friends will understand. Find good friends.\n          </p>\n                  \n          <br />\n\n          <h3 className={classes.title}>\n            Security and Self-Confidence\n          </h3>\n          <p>\n            Dating apps are pretty objective and rather surface level for obvious reasons. \n            People will judge you on your physical appearance, education, and occupation (or company). \n            What I find the most interesting is that it has always been this way growing up for Asians across the world. \n            It’s mostly laughable that on this Facebook group, <i>Subtle <b>Asian</b> Dating</i>, that there are a ton of people that like “auctioning” \n            off their friends by emphasizing qualities that they personally think are selling points. \n            I found that it is just a huge projection of what these people value and as a result, think others would value as well.  \n            <br /><br />\n            The qualities people really focus on are the ones most Asian parents think are valuable and happen to be both naturally objective and tangible. \n            Objective qualities, characteristics, or “defining” background information can be:\n            <br />\n            <ul>\n              <li>\n                <i>Height</i>: If people are being surface level and objective then why not put weight too?\n              </li>\n              <li>\n               <i>School</i>: X school most Asian parents would be proud of so “you know they’re smart.”\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i>Major</i>: X major most Asian parents would be happy with or can be lucrative in so “you know they got $$$.”\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i>Profession</i>: X occupation most Asian parents would be pleased with so “you know they have a future.”\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i>Interests</i>:\n                <ul>\n                  <li>\n                    Probably things they were forced into their entire lives like piano, badminton, etc.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Post-graduate hobbies that don’t require direct competition, a strong athletic foundation, \n                    intense hand eye coordination like rock climbing, powerlifting, marathon running, bouldering, etc.\n                  </li>\n                  <li>\n                    Set of activities that will uphold their “personality” or re-assure them that they can truly fit in like drinking milk tea, “raving,” etc.\n                  </li>\n                </ul>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <i>Pictures</i>: Got to add something that requires pure objectivity right?\n              </li>\n            </ul>\n            Before you know it, you have 100x carbon copies of the same Asian person but in different bodies and places across the world.\n            \n            After scrolling through endless auctions because Facebook’s awesome algos love to blow these posts up in my face, \n            I began to feel a lot of reassurance in who I was as a person. This feeling transpired over the course of time because I began to ask myself:\n            <br /><br />\n            <Quote\n                text=\"What do I think are my refining qualities?\"\n            />\n            <Quote\n                text=\"What do I personally value in life, people, or myself?\"\n            />\n            It’s an interesting perspective because I believe that for a lot of people, they tend to focus on what others think, value, and care about \n            relative to themselves which leads to people pleasing. Parents may think engineering, medical, or business are the most preferred lines of \n            work and because they place so much value on it, they incept the idea that so will others (future potential significant others). \n            Similarly because we’re a social species, the same goes with how social media reflects on people’s actions. \n            It’s a rabbit hole of unfulfillment if one is trying to live someone else’s due to their envy, crave, and yearn for something they don’t have \n            but place superficial value on.\n            <br /><br />\n            When it came specifically to myself, I started to understand that all the things I really did love or appreciate about myself were unquantifiable and intangible. \n            I realized that having an objective laundry list of qualities, hobbies, or goals would always make me want to do more and we really \n            don’t have time to pursue everything on a surface-level, so internal growth began to be my number one priority over the course of the year. \n            As I understood and learned more about myself, the more I loved who I was and the less I cared about external reaffirmation.\n            <br /><br />\n            With that being said, I’d like to refer to an excerpt from Daniel Sloss’ Jigsaw stand-up special regarding relationships and self-love.\n            <br /><br />\n            <div className={classes.typo}>\n              <Quote\n                text=\"You have to learn to love yourself before you can allow someone else to do it as well. \n                      That’s it.

          because how can you offer who you are if you don’t know who you are? \n                      There’s nothing wrong with being selfish for a bit because you’ve got the rest of your life to be selfless. \n                      If you only love yourself at 20%, that means somebody can come along and love you 30%. \n                      You’re like, ‘Wow, that’s so much.’ It’s literally less than half. \n                      Whereas if you love yourself 100%, a person that falls in love with you has to go above and beyond the call of duty to make you feel special. \n
